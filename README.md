## Insert Node in BST
````
insertNodeInBST(BSTNODE root, int ele)
Step-1: Create a new node temp with given value ele and set its left and rightfield to NULL.
Step-2: If root is equal to NULL set temp as root.
Step-3: If root is not equal to empty , check if the ele is smaller or larger than the root node
Step-4: If ele is smaller than or equal to the node, then move to its left child. If ele is larger than the node, then move to its right child.
Step-5: Repeat the steps 3 and 4 until we reach a leaf node.
Step-6: After reaching a leaf node, then insert the newNode as left child if newNode is smaller or equal to that leaf else insert it as right child.

## Inorder Traversal
````
inorderInBST(BSTNODE root)
Step-1: Traverse the elements in the left subtree of the root node. i.e call inorderInBST(root->left).
Step-2: Visit the root node i.e. print the data field of the root
Step-3: Traverse the elements in the right subtree of the root node. i.e call inorderInBST(root->right).
````
## Preorder Traversal
````
preorderInBST(BSTNODE root)
Step-1: Visit the root node
Step-2: Traverse the elements in the left sub tree of the root node. i.e call preorderInBST(root->left).
Step-3: Traverse the elements in the right sub tree of the root node. i.e call preorderInBST(root->right).
````
## Postorder Traversal
 ````
postorderInBST(BSTNODE root)
Step-1: Traverse the elements in the left sub tree of the root node. i.e call postorderInBST(root->left).
Step-2: Traverse the elements in the right sub tree of the root node. i.e call postorderInBST(root->right).
Step-3: Visit the root node
````
## Deleting a Node
````
deleteNodeInBST(BSTNODE root, int ele)
Node to be deleted is a leaf :
Step-1: Simply deallocate the memory allocated to the node.

Node to be deleted has one child (either left or right ) :
Step-1: Copy the child node (either left or right) to the node to be deleted.
Step-2: Delete the child node.

Node to be deleted has both left child and right child :
Step-1: Find the minimum value node in the right sub tree say temp. [It is the left most node in the right sub tree of the node to be deleted]
Step-2: Copy the data of temp in the node to be deleted.
Step-3: Delete the temp node from the right sub tree of the node to be deleted.
````
## Searching
````
searchNodeInBST(BSTNODE root, int ele)
Step-1: IF root -> DATA = ITEM OR root= NULL, Return ROOT
Step-2: ELSE IF root < root -> DATA
Step-3: Return search(root -> LEFT, ITEM)
Step-4: ELSE, Return search(ROOT -> RIGHT,ITEM)
